        <p class="text-block">
          IT now is integrated at all levels of business. Large businesses once
          used large computers dedicated to single uses such as payroll then the
          introduction of personal computers brought business technology and
          cost savings to small businesses. Word processors, spreadsheets and
          databases generate files and data that can be organised and searched
          and are time efficient compared to paper records.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Communication tools have evolved with email and messaging systems and
          the world wide web has made any company’s website the first point of
          contact and made sales available globally via ecommerce.

          successfully
        </h2>

        <p class="text-block">
          The starting point of a digital project is to identify the problem
          that the project is addressing and it’s possible solutions. The goals
          should be clearly defined and once method has been chosen to achieve
          these you can decide on the work that needs to be done. This solution
          should be achievable within the time available. Unrealistic goals will
          probably result in failure.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Tasks should be broken down into small manageable chunks that can be
          easily tracked with project management software such as Trello. This
          should show what needs to be done once the reasons why these tasks
          need to be done and how to do them has been decided on.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Deciding when these tasks should be done and prioritising tasks
          effectively then becomes important. There is a difference between
          important and urgent and there is no point prioritising everything as
          urgent

          The website involves some basic planning. The main content is text
          which needs to be written. Any images or media need to be created or
          acquired but there are no extra elements to consider such as forms,
          maps or image slideshows.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          This website will consist of a number of sections of text each
          contained in a div which will be identified in a heading. These
          sections will be split into several linked pages. The number of
          individual pages for the content should be decided on and set up. A
          navigation system to link the pages should be added. Internal jump
          links should be added to allow easy access to information within a
          page and the links addedThe sections are organised by the page where
          they will appear and the status of content creation and placement
          tracked on Trello.

        <p class="text-block">
          Projects can fail for many reasons. If the reason for the project is
          unclear or loosely defined it can be difficult to find the best way to
          reach a final product. Improper planning leaves a project with no
          clear direction. Feature creep at an early stage can lead to a lack of
          focus on the essentials
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Trying to do too much at once will ensure that nothing is finished. At
          the very least a project should have an achievable minimum viable
          product to aim for. This can then be enhanced progressively at a later
          date. This will ensure that the project is working in the shortest
          time. No product is ever perfect or fully finished and improvements
          and changes will always be required.

        <p class="text-block">
          There are many ways of approaching any digital project with a plethora
          of tools available for any task. A technology stack is a combination
          of libraries or tools, languages, and frameworks that developers can
          choose from and these choices can be overwhelming with new
          technologies constantly appearing.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Planning a web project will depend on the size of a project. A simple
          website could consist of static linked web-pages. For quick projects
          that have to be working quickly, a content management system like such
          as Wordpress and a ready made style-theme may be the most suitable
          option.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          As websites become more complex then different front end and back end
          (server) systems may become appropriate.

          Visual Studio Code for editing the html and css files works well
          although I prefer to write the content for the website in a word
          processor such as google docs to check for spelling and grammar
          errors. I am using an online photo editor, pixlr, to scale and crop
          images.

          Task management of content, blocks, pages finished, links, images etc
          with Trello has proved to be very useful. The status of the styling
          was also tracked and an issue column set up for the problems found as
          the work progresses.

          A version control system would probably help with rethinking page
          structure and reverted to working versions of code once a new idea has
          proved to be unsatisfactory

          privacy legislation with laws about personal data, privacy and
          consent. With GDPR, organisations have to ensure that personal data is
          gathered legally under strict conditions including explicit op-ins to
          give consent to do this. They have to protect this information, and
          give access to people’s own personal data, show how it is being used
          and delete it if requested.
