          The Image editor was fine for simple use but to expand the site with
          more images might require more advanced software to optimise and batch
          process image files
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Prototyping software could have been used to design alternative
          interfaces and variations before writing any code. This would enable a
          designto be chosen before any markup is created and provide a plan of
          how to achieve the final site.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          For this simple website it was possible to work alone but division of
          tasks would have made the project simpler.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The tasks could have been broken up into different areas of expertise
          such as content writing, adding content to html pages, web styling,
          image processing etc.

          3.2: ways to improve productivity and efficiency
        </h2>

        <p class="text-block">
          There are a number of ways that productivity could be improved. Using
          version control would enable trying out new ideas for the markup and
          styling solution. New ideas could be explored and reverted if not
          working
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          I could possibly have test pages with small amounts of content to test
          concepts for the interface before adding it to the main pages.
        </p>

        <p class="text-block">
          If this web site project was to be repeated I would design a set of
          purely visual designs for the look and feel of the website. Once a
          final design was decided on then I could write markup and styling to
          conform to this.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Working as a team would have helped with productivity. Content could
          have been written while the design phase was being completed. This
          would enabled these tasks to be concentrated on without constantly
          changing the type of work being done. Then once the markup required
          has been added content could be dropped in.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Slack could help with this collaborative working. If channels are
          created for the different work areas then all the messages are
          visible. Finished content can be shared easily and anyone who joins
          the project can see what has been decided on and what work has been
          worked on and discussed. This help to review the progress of the
          project and see who is involved with the different aspects of the
          work.

          Testing of the website by other users can reveal whether they find
          anything confusing on the site or hard to navigate. These problems can
          then be resolved.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Once all the content is added and the styling and menus are updated
          and tested I would test the website at different screen sizes to check
          that it works at different resolutions.
        </p>

        <p class="text-block">
          Once this step is complete I would then test it on different web
          browsers and devices to check for any other errors.

          Automated testing software is available for website testing. Selenium
          is one solution that is open source and tests web applications across
          different browsers.
