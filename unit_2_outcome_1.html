          The pages are split into sections based on the unit outcomes and each
          page is structured in a similar way. A fixed position video background
          covers the viewable screen. An image in a rounded box is positioned to
          the top right of the page.

          A navigation bar, styled with flex-box runs across the top of the
          screen to access the different pages with the main heading page below
          it. A secondary fixed navigation block gives access to the targeted
          sections within the page.

        <p class="text-block">
          The main content is positioned in a containing div. This holds the

          with a transparent background to ensure visibility over the background
          image.

        <p class="text-block">
          There are many websites that provide images or other content. Some are
          free for use on non commercial websites or require attribution. Others
          provide content free for use for any purpose. High quality stock
          content usually involves paying a royalty fee for it's use.

        <h2>1.6: Accessibility</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          There are a number of ways to ensure that a website can be usable by
          as many people as possible. Making a website accessible to people with
          disabilities also benefits people using mobile devices, or those with
          slow network connections.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          People with visual impairments such as blindness or poor vision can
          use a variety of accessibility tools. Screen readers read digital text
          out loud and screen magnifiers make text appear larger. The use of
          alt-tags to label images and using semantic HTML to organise your
          content, which improves accessibility for screen readers also improves
          Search Engines Optimisation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          People with colour blindness can be helped to access web content by
          paying attention to text and image contrast and not putting text over
          images.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          People with mobility impairments may be unable to use a mouse and the
          website should be navigable by keyboard or an equivalent only, for
          example using the tab key to move between the different parts of a
          form.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          People with cognitive impairments may have difficulty with
          understanding content or be confused by inconsistent or confusing page
          design. Consistent layout and navigation that everyone is familiar
          with will make websites easy to use.
