        <p class="text-block">
          Breaking down the task list into very small parts has made tracking
          efficient. Lists of each content, block, page done, links, images etc
          with Trello has proved to be very useful. The status of the styling
          was also tracked.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The use of Visual Studio Code as an html editor is effective. Code
          completion and link completion is very useful and the colour editor
          worked well. Initial content has to be written in a word processor
          such as google docs to check for spelling and grammar errors.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Images were resized and edited online using https://pixlr.com/ which
          now no longer needs a flash plug-in to work and made the graphics
          editing simple.

        <p class="text-block">
          What can I say about Trello that hasnâ€™t been said before? For a
          project of this size the Trello board was very effective. On a larger
          project maybe a project manager designed for software development such
          as Jira would be more appropriate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Visual Studio Code worked well with all the files needed. On a larger
          website project maybe some research into appropriate extensions to
          make html and css work faster would be suitable.

        <p class="text-block">
          The website is displaying the content in a legible way and the menus
          and internal page menus are working.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The styling could be improved and the website tested with other users
          to assess any problems that they find with it. The internal page
          navigation could be improved by being smaller and using icons.

        <p class="text-block">
          The content boxes are all displayed in order. It may be better to hide
          all but one content section and then close it and open the next
          section using the internal page navigation menu.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The display of the content boxes could be animated with CSS animation
          or JavaScript.
