        <p class="text-block">
          Breaking down the task list into very small parts has made tracking
          efficient. Lists of each content, block, page done, links, images etc
          with Trello has proved to be very useful. The status of the styling
          was also tracked.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The use of Visual Studio Code as an html editor is effective. Code
          completion and link completion is very useful and the colour editor
          worked well. Initial content has to be written in a word processor
          such as google docs to check for spelling and grammar errors.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Images were resized and edited online using pixlr.com which now no
          longer needs a flash plug-in to work and made the graphics editing
          simple.

        <p class="text-block">
          What can I say about Trello that hasnâ€™t been said before? For a
          project of this size the Trello board was very effective. On a larger
          project maybe a project manager designed for software development such
          as Jira would be more appropriate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Visual Studio Code worked well with all the files needed. On a larger
          website project maybe some research into appropriate extensions to
          make html and css work faster would be suitable.

          The website is displaying the content in a legible way and the menus
          and internal page menus are working.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The styling could be improved and the website tested with other users
          to assess any problems that they find with it. The internal page
          navigation could be improved by being smaller and using icons.

        <p class="text-block">
          The content boxes are all displayed in order. It may be better to hide
          all but one content section and then close it and open the next
          section using the internal page navigation menu.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The display of the content boxes could be animated with CSS animation
          or JavaScript.

          The required outcome questions have been addressed. All the content
          has been added to the website in a structured way. The content has
          been proof-read, although there is always the possibility that some
          errors have slipped through and may need to be corrected later.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The missing content has been added. The images are displaying
          correctly and the video background is working. Alt tags and titles
          have been added to the image for accessibility. The pages are all
          found and the navigation is working. Links to the pages and content
          sections have been added and tested. The styling is adequate to make
          all the content legible and accessible. The website has been tested in
          different browsers.
