        </h2>

        <p class="text-block">
          I have been using technology for a long, long time. I made 3D graphics
          in POVRAY using text files generated from Excel. I got excited when
          Photoshop 4 introduced layers. I used Netscape Navigator. I remember
          the horror of the blink tag, "website under construction" gifs and
          making websites work in Internet Explorer 6. On the other hand, the
          web is full of cats.
        </p>

        <p class="text-block">
          I have worked in a variety of jobs over many years that have included
          advertising, video production and graphic design. Over the years I
          have built a number of CMS based websites and focussed on delivering
          easily updatable content as fast as possible. This has meant that I
          have not concentrated on other aspects of web technology.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          IT is always a rapidly changing sector and the tools I have used, my
          working methods are becoming outdated and I now need to update my
          skills. This includes finally learning to code properly, work
          collaboratively and not hack about with quick fixes to IT problems. I
          think the courses at Code Nation are the best way for me to achieve
          this.
